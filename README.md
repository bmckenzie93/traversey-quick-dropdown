I am going to start the project now, I watched the video through once and I have done a similar project to this before, so this should be an easy one for me.

I got most of it done without having to refer back to the video but I got stuck when trying to get the nested ul to display on hover properly. I needed to add left: 0, margin-top, and a width to it. 
//clocked out.

I am about to finish this up then move on to the css grid portion of the course next.
