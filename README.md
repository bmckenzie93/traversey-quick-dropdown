# traversey-quick-dropdown
A quick project from traversey media's udemy course on html/css: Quick dropdown menu project

@ 9:30am
I am going to start the project now, I watched the video through once and I have done a similar project to this before, so this should be an easy one for me.

@ 10:30am
I got most of it done without having to refer back to the video but I got stuck when trying to get the nested ul to display on hover properly. I needed to add left: 0, margin-top, and a width to it.
